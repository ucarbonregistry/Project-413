# Project-413
Small Scale Wind Power Project by S.G.P.L
The proposed project titled under UCR is “2.7 MW Wind Power Project by S.G.P.L”, which is wind
power project located in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose of this plant installation and power
generation is for captive consumption. PP has the full ownership of the project activity. The project is
an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal
Carbon Registry” (UCR).

A.1.1 Purpose of the project activity:
As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 8,278 MWh of electricity per
anum considering an average PLF 35%. The project activity is a renewable power generation activity
which incorporates installation and operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having
capacity of 2.7 MW manufactured and supplied GE India Industrial Private Limited respectively in
district Devbhumi Dwarka of the state of Gujarat in India. This project has been promoted by M/s
Sentosa Granito Pvt. Ltd.

The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 29/03/2022 by Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.
As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 8,278 MWh of electricity per
annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the
project proponent (PP). Wheeling Agreement is signed between Paschim Gujarat Vij Company
Limited (PGVCL) and PP The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid
electricity resulting in emission reduction of 7,450 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been
helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy)
for generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants,
which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 7,450 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
Since the project activity generates electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts
